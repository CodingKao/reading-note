## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**
> A syntax error occurs when a program is written in a language but the code is incorrect according to the rules of that language. This results in an error message when the program is executed.
>
>A logic error occurs when the code is syntactically correct, but the program does not do what the programmer intended. This usually results in the program executing incorrectly or not producing the desired output.

**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**
> 1. Syntax Error - This is when the code has a typo or improper syntax that causes the program to not compile. I was able to correct this by checking my code for typos and/or making sure that the syntax was correct.
>
> 2. Logic Error - This is when the code has the correct syntax but does not produce the desired output. I was able to correct this by debugging the code and making sure everything was running as expected.
>
> 3. Runtime Error - This is when the code runs but produces an unexpected result. I was able to correct this by re-checking the logic and making sure that the variables were initialized correctly.


**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**
> Troubleshooting JavaScript will continue to influence my long term goals by helping me become a better and more efficient coder. It will provide me with the necessary skills to solve coding problems and debug any issues that may arise in my future projects. Knowing how to troubleshoot JavaScript problems quickly and effectively will be essential for my long-term success as a programmer.

## The JavaScript Debugger.

**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**
> The JavaScript Debugger tool is a powerful tool used to identify and fix errors in JavaScript code. It allows developers to pause the execution of their code at any point and inspect the values of variables, step through the code line by line, and use breakpoints to investigate and debug issues. Debugging helps developers understand how their code works and find and solve any issues quickly and efficiently.

**Define what a breakpoint is.**
> A breakpoint is a feature of a debugger which allows the user to pause the execution of code at a specific line. This allows the user to examine the program's state, such as local variables and parameters, and to step through the execution of the code line by line.

**What is the call stack?**
> The call stack is a data structure in JavaScript that stores the sequence of function calls that occur when a program is executed. The call stack allows the program to keep track of where it is in the code and which functions are currently executing.
