> Images are an important part of HTML content. Common image types used in HTML are GIFs, JPEGs, and PNGs. GIFs are suitable for simple images, while JPEGs and PNGs are better for more complex images. Images can be styled in HTML using the width and height attributes, as well as by using CSS. Colors can also be used in CSS to further style an image. CSS can be used to add a border and background color, as well as to set the position, alignment, and other visual aspects of the image. Images can be used to enhance the appearance of a webpage and make it more engaging for users.

## HTML Media

**What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?**
> The alt attribute can be used to provide text descriptions of images on a website, which is helpful for visually impaired people as they use screen readers to navigate the site.

**How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**
>There are several ways to improve the accessibility of images in an HTML document. Alt text should be provided for each image to give a description to users with screen readers. Additionally, images should be scaled to an appropriate size and include width and height attributes. Finally, it is also recommended to use a descriptive file name for the image itself.

**Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**
> The figure element is useful for embedding images and other graphical elements, such as diagrams and charts, in an HTML document. The figure element allows the image to be annotated and referenced in the text of the document. For example, a figure element can be used to display a graph illustrating the current sales trends of a company, with a caption that explains the graph and its implications.

**Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**
> A GIF image is a type of image file that is made up of a series of static images that are played in a loop, like a short video. An SVG image is a type of image file that is made up of a series of lines, shapes and colors that can be scaled to any size without losing quality. In other words, a GIF image is like a short video, while an SVG image is more like a diagram or drawing.

**What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**
> The best image type to use for displaying screenshots on a website is a Portable Network Graphic (PNG). PNGs are lossless, meaning that they retain all of the data within the image and therefore produce a higher quality image with no loss of detail. They also support transparency, making it easy to add text or logos over the image, and they are usually smaller in file size than other image types, making them faster to download.

## Learn CSS

**Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**
> Foreground colors refer to the color of the text or any other data contained within an HTML element, while background colors refer to the color of the element itself, such as its background color or border color.

**Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**
> I would use a bright, contrasting color palette to create visual interest and draw attention to key content. I would create a bold, eye-catching header and use color to highlight calls to action, giving the website some personality and personality.

**What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**
> When choosing fonts for an HTML document, consider readability, size, and style to fit the desired design aesthetic.

**What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?**
>Font-size sets the size of the text, font-weight sets the boldness of the text, and font-style sets the style of the text, such as italic or oblique.

**Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.**
>
> 1. You could add padding to the h1 element by setting the padding property to a specific amount in the CSS.
> 2. You could also set the margin property to a specific amount in the CSS, which would add spacing around the element.
