> Psychological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. It's an environment in which people feel accepted, respected, and comfortable being themselves. It's also a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up.

**What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?**
> 1. Respectful communication that encourages open dialogue.
> 2. An environment of trust and support.
> 3. Clear roles and expectations that foster collaboration.

**Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.**
> I have worked in many different type of teams in college.  Some better than others.  The teams that I was involved in that I felt performed the best were the teams that had a high degree of psychological safety where the team had an authentic open dialogue and each team memeber were valued for their input even though their input was not related to the goal.  Building rapport and trust within the team will make the team members more committed to the overall success of the team.  I've been in teams where one person takes full charge and control of the team and doesn't value other's input, which caused the rest of the team to be less comitted and only do their minimum parts.  This lead to the "team leader" to do most of the work.

**What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?**
> These teams are more likely to foster innovation, creativity, and collaboration, leading to higher levels of productivity and better decision making. Team members tend to be more engaged and willing to take risks, and they are more likely to feel supported and valued by their colleagues.
