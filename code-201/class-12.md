> Video, audio, and images are important components in HTML, CSS, and Javascript as they add a visual and interactive experience for the user. These elements can help to make webpages more engaging and attractive. They can also help to convey more information in a more effective way than text alone.

## JavaScript Canvas

**What does the \<canvas> allow a developer to acheive?**
> The \<canvas> element allows developers to create and render graphics on a webpage. It can be used to draw shapes, add images, create animations, and more. It provides a platform for developers to create dynamic and interactive graphics for web applications. The \<canvas> element is also used for game development and can be used to render 2D and 3D graphics.

**What is the importance of the closing `</canvas> tag?**
> The closing \</canvas> tag is important for properly ending the canvas element and ensuring that all other HTML elements appear in the correct order on the page. It also helps maintain the structure of the page so that the page can be rendered correctly by the browser.

**Explain what the getContext() method does.**
> The getContext() method retrieves the drawing context of an HTML canvas element, allowing the user to draw shapes, images, and text on the canvas.
