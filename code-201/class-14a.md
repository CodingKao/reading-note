> CSS transforms, transitions, and animations allow web developers to create dynamic, interactive, and eye-catching experiences for their users. CSS transforms enable developers to manipulate HTML elements, while CSS transitions and animations allow for smooth, gradual changes between different states of an element. These features enable developers to create unique and visually appealing experiences that can improve user engagement and satisfaction.

## CSS Transforms

**What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?**
> CSS transforms allow developers to manipulate the position, rotation, scaling, and skewing of an element on the webpage. This can be used to move elements around, rotate them, zoom in/out, and/or skew them. Transformations can also be used to create interesting visual effects, such as animating elements to appear or disappear from the page.

**Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.**
> A transform could be used to scale an image on a website. This could be used to make sure the image fits the size of the webpage, regardless of the user's device size.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

**What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**
> A CSS transition allows the developer to animate an element from one state to another, such as changing its size, color, or location, over a period of time. It can also be used to add a smooth transition when hovering over an element or when changing the state of an element in response to a user action.

**How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**
> A CSS animation is a multi-step process that sets specific points for the transition to occur, whereas a CSS transition is a single-step process that occurs over a specified duration.

**How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?**
> As a software developer, I strive to create engaging user experiences with dynamic visual elements. CSS transforms, transitions and animations help me do this by providing a powerful and efficient means to animate elements on the page.
