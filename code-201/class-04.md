***
>Creating hyperlinks, CSS layout, and JavaScript functions are important in software development because they provide structure, style, and interactivity to the user interface of a website or application. Hyperlinks allow the user to navigate between pages and content, while CSS provides styling and layout options, such as colors, fonts, and margins. JavaScript functions provide interactivity and allow the user to perform actions such as submitting a form or making an animation. All of these elements combined create a cohesive, user-friendly experience.
