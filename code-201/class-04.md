***
> Creating hyperlinks, CSS layout, and JavaScript functions are important in software development because they provide structure, style, and interactivity to the user interface of a website or application. Hyperlinks allow the user to navigate between pages and content, while CSS provides styling and layout options, such as colors, fonts, and margins. JavaScript functions provide interactivity and allow the user to perform actions such as submitting a form or making an animation. All of these elements combined create a cohesive, user-friendly experience.

## Learn HTML

**To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**
> A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an \<a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

**The href attribute contains what information?**
>The href attribute contains a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that specifies the link's destination.

**What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**
> Use descriptive link text; avoid using phrases such as "click here"; provide alternative text for images; make sure links are visible and clearly distinguishable from surrounding text.

## CSS Layout
**What is meant by “normal flow”?**
> Normal flow is a concept used in web design and development to describe the order in which elements of a web page are laid out and displayed on the screen. It is based on the natural order of the HTML elements, and it is the default layout used by most browsers. 

**What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?**
> Block-level elements are elements that take up their own line and are usually rectangles, while inline elements are elements that are embedded in other elements and usually have a single line.

**___ positioning is the default for every html element.**
> Static positioning is the default that every element gets. It just means "put the element into its normal position in the document flow — nothing special to see here."

**Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**
>
-  Greater control over the exact location of elements on the page.
-  Ability to layer elements on top of each other.
-  Flexibility to place elements outside of the normal flow of a page.
-  Ability to place elements in precise locations relative to the browser window.
-  Ability to create complex layouts without the need for floats or other positioning techniques.

**What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**
> Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

## Learn JS

**Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**
> Function declaration: A function declaration is a block of code that defines a set of instructions that can be used to perform a specific task. It typically consists of a function name, input parameters, and a return value.
>
>Function invocation: A function invocation is the act of calling a function. This involves passing arguments to the function and executing the function's code. The function invocation is a way of telling the computer to perform the task specified in the function declaration.

**What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**
> A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters. In other words, parameters are variables in a method definition, whereas arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters.

## Miscellaneous
> Pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.
> Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.  The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
>
> Engaged collaboration - I plan to use engaged collaboration in pair programming to work together and solve problems more efficiently and effectively. It allows me to discuss ideas and share perspectives to come up with creative solutions.
>
> Social skills - Pair programming allows me to practice communication, collaboration, and problem-solving with someone else, which helps me develop my social skills.
