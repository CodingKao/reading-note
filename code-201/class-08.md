## Learn CSS - Flexbox

**Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**
> Flexbox is a layout option in CSS that is designed to lay out content in one-dimensional space. This means that Flexbox is best suited for content that can be laid out in a single line or column, such as a horizontal navigation bar or a vertical list of items. Flexbox is able to adjust the size and position of the items within the container to make the best use of the space available. Itâ€™s not suited for more complex, two-dimensional layouts like grids or tables.

**Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**
> The main axis is the main direction of a flex container along which flex items are laid out. Flex items are laid out along the main axis in the order specified by the flex-direction property.
>
>The cross axis is the axis perpendicular to the main axis. Flex items are laid out along the cross axis according to the flex-wrap property. The alignment of flex items along the cross axis can be adjusted using the align-items property.

**How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?.**
> Using certain properties of flexbox can negatively impact accessibility by creating content that is not accessible to certain users. For example, using the flex-wrap property can create content that is too small for users with low vision to read, and using the flex-grow property can cause items to be placed in an order that does not make sense for users with cognitive disabilities. Additionally, using the auto margins properties can cause content to be placed in a way that is not easily seen or understood by screen readers.
