**1. What are four important features to look for in a text editor?**

>1. Code Completion - Code
completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed
>2. Syntax Highlighting - Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text
>3. A nice variety of themes - Themes will allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,
and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software as well
>4. Ability to choose from a selection of extensions - Extensions will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality
as you need it


**2. What do the following commands do?**
> - pwd - Print Working Direction tells you what your current or present working directory is.
> - ls - List the contents of a directory. 
> - cd - Change directory allows you to move around in the system.
> - mkdir - Make directory allows you to create a directory.
> - touch - Create a blank file




**3. Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)**

> - cd projects - change directory to projects
> - mkdir new-project - make new directory named "new-project"
> - touch new-project/newfile.md - create a blank file for "newfile"
> - cd .. - change current directory back one level
> - ls projects/new-project - list contents for new-project
