**What is control flow?**
>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.


**What is a JavaScript function?**
>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
>
>A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).


**What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?**
>The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:
>
>1. When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
>2. When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
>3. Automatically (self invoked)


**What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?**
>A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
>
>Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
>The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
>(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
>
>Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
>Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
>Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.
