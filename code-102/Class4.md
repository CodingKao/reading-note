**What is HTML and why do we use it?**
>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is a language used to create web pages and applications. It is used to structure and present content on the World Wide Web, and is the foundation of most websites. HTML is used to define the content and structure of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. It can also be used to add styling and interactivity to web pages.


**What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?**
>1. **Tag**: The tag is the element type indicated by a keyword surrounded by angle brackets, such as '<h1>'.
>2. **Content**: The content of the element is the information between the opening and closing tags. This could be text, HTML, or a combination of both.
>3. **Element**: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.


**What is it called when you give an element extra information?**
>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.
Sometimes known as adding annotation or metadata to an element.


**What is a semantic element?**
>In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code.  A semantic element is an HTML element that conveys meaning to the reader, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables. Semantic elements give structure and meaning to web pages and help search engines better understand the content on the page.
