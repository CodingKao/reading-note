**What is the purpose of CSS?**
>CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users â€” how they are styled, laid out, etc.  The purpose of CSS is to provide a style layer for HTML documents, enabling developers to create visually appealing webpages. CSS enables developers to define the look and feel of a website, such as the font, colors, and layout, without having to code each page individually.


**What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?**
>The three ways to insert CSS into a project are:
>
>1. Inline CSS: style attributes are added directly to HTML elements. 
>2. Internal CSS: style rules are placed within the <head> section of the HTML document using <style> element. 
>3. External CSS: style rules are placed in an external file, which is referenced from the HTML document using the '<link>' element.
	

**Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all /*<p>*/ elements red text.**
>
    p { color: red; }
