# Reflection on using Git

This exercise taught me the importance of using git for version control, as well as the importance of creating an organized folder structure to store your project files. I learned how to create a repository on GitHub, clone the repository to my local machine, create branches, add files to the repository, commit changes, and push them back to GitHub. Additionally, I learned how to create and modify a README file to provide information about the project.
