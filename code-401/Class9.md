## Idea 1: Online School Planner
Create an online school planner where students can log in, create tasks, set deadlines, and track their progress. Only authorized users can access their own tasks, ensuring privacy and security.

## Idea 2: Volunteer Matching Platform:
Build a platform that connects volunteers with organizations and projects based on their skills and interests. Allow volunteers to browse and apply for opportunities, and organizations to post volunteer positions.

## Idea 3: Pet Adoption Platform:
Develop an online platform that connects pet seekers with animal shelters and pet owners looking to rehome their pets. Include search filters, profiles, and adoption application features.

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**

My goal is to build a CMS application with API server, authentication, and database operations.
