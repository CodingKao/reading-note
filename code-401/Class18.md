## AWS API Gateway Overview

**What is Amazon API Gateway?**
> Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define and connect HTTP endpoints of a REST or WebSocket API to backend business logic, handling authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

**Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?**
> Amazon API Gateway is crucial in the Serverless ecosystem as it enables serverless architecture for web applications, providing scalability, low maintenance, and cost-effectiveness without the need for managing servers.

**How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?**
> API Gateway integrates with AWS services like Lambda, SNS, IAM, and Cognito for authentication, authorization, and metrics/tracing of API requests.

## AWS API Gateway

**What are the some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway?**
> Some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway include efficient API development, scalability and performance, cost savings, easy monitoring, and flexible security controls.

**What two API types might you choose from?**
> The two API types you can choose from are RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs.

## AWS DynamoDB Guide

**What is DynamoDB?**
> DynamoDB is an AWS-hosted NoSQL database that offers reliable performance, a managed experience, and a simple API for key-value access and advanced queries.

**Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?**
> DynamoDB is recommended over MongoDB for applications with large data, strict latency requirements, serverless architecture, and simple access patterns.

## AWS DynamoDB

**Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.**
> DynamoDB is like a hosted database that stores data in a reliable and scalable way, making it easily accessible for applications.


## Dynamoose

**What is Dynamoose?**
> Dynamoose is a JavaScript library that simplifies working with Amazon DynamoDB by providing an easy-to-use object modeling interface.

**What are some key features of Dynamoose?**
> Dynamoose provides features like schema definition, validation, querying, and easy integration with Amazon DynamoDB for simplified development.


## Reflection

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
> To understand AWS API Gateway, Lambda integration, differences between HTTP and REST APIs, DynamoDB usage with Dynamoose, and creating API endpoints.
