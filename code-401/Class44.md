**Ethical dilemma of self driving cars**
> The article talks about the ethical issues related to self-driving cars. It raises the question of who the cars should prioritize when faced with unavoidable accidents and discusses the need for programming artificial intelligence to make ethical decisions. I agree with the article's focus on ethics in technology and the importance of considering the moral implications of self-driving cars. It's challenging to decide how the cars should make split-second decisions that may harm some individuals while protecting others. The article also mentions the double standard between human drivers and machines, as humans are often given more leeway due to their human frailties. This raises interesting questions about how we view and hold machines accountable for their actions. Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the ethical dilemmas surrounding self-driving cars and the need to address these issues as technology advances.
