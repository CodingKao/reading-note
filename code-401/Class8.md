## 5 steps to RBAC

**What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?**
> Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a system that assigns access to users based on their job roles in an organization. It helps manage access rights, making it easier to control and secure sensitive information.

**Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.**
> In a school, a basic user can access email and the school website, while a teacher can access student grades and lesson plans, and an administrator has full control over the school's systems.

**What approach might you take to implement RBAC?**
> To implement RBAC, first, make a list of the resources you want to control access to. Then, group people into roles based on their access needs and assign them accordingly. Regularly review and update roles

**If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?**
> Authorization is like getting permission to do something after proving your identity. It determines what actions or access you are allowed based on who you are.

**Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.**
> - Role assignment: You can do things only if you have a specific role assigned.
> - Role authorization: Your role must be authorized.
> - Permission authorization: You can do certain things only if they are authorized for your role.

**Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.**
> RBAC is like giving different roles to people, such as students, teachers, and principals. Each role has certain permissions, like access to books or the ability to make rules.

## RBAC tutorial

**What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.**
> In RBAC, access rights are associated with roles, not directly with users. Users are assigned roles, and those roles determine the access rights the users have.

**Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?**
> Access rights, or authorization, are activated after a user successfully authenticates or proves their identity to the system.

**Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.**
> RBAC can benefit a business by simplifying user management, ensuring authorized access to resources, and improving security by assigning roles and permissions effectively.

## Reflection

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
> My goals are to understand how authorization works in computer systems, learn about roles and capabilities, and implement access control in my own projects.
