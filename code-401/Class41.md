## Next.js

**Teach us two things about Next.js.**

> 1. Next.js is a framework for building web applications.
    With Next.js, you can build user interfaces using React components. Then, Next.js provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.
> 2. Next.js built-in features includes:
>       - An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
>       - Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
>       - Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
>       - Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
>       - Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
>       - Development environment with Fast Refresh support
>       - API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
>       - Fully extendable


## Gatsby.js

**Teach us two things about Gatsby.js..**

> 1. Gatsby enables developers to build fast, secure, and powerful websites using a React-based framework and innovative data layer that makes integrating different content, APIs, and services into one web experience incredibly simple.
> 2. The key feature of Gatsby.js is its ability to generate static HTML files during the build process, which can be served directly to the client. This approach results in faster load times, improved performance, and better search engine optimization (SEO).
