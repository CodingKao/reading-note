## An introduction to NodeJS and Express

**Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.**
> Middleware is a layer of software that acts as a bridge between different applications, allowing them to communicate and share data efficiently.

**Express the most popular __ __ ____.**
> Express is the most popular Node web framework


**Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?**
> Express being "unopinionated" means it doesn't impose strict rules or preferences on how you develop web applications, giving you more flexibility.


**What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?**
> Modules are self-contained code units that serve specific functions, and their modularity is useful to developers for efficient organization, reusability, and simplified maintenance.

## What is NPM?

**What version of npm are you running on your machine?**
> 9.6.4

**What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?**
> npm install jshint

## What is TDD?

**Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.**
> Tests are crucial because they help ensure that the code works as intended, catch bugs early, provide confidence in software quality, and make future changes safer and more predictable.

**What are three expected benefits of testing**
> Testing provides three benefits: bug detection, software quality assurance, and code maintainability.

**Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.**
> - Individual pitfalls: Overcomplicating tests, neglecting edge cases.
> - Team pitfalls: Lack of communication, inconsistent testing practices.

## CI/CD

**What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?**
> Three benefits of Continuous Integration are early bug detection, faster feedback loop, and improved collaboration among developers.

**What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?**
> Continuous Delivery involves manual approval for software releases, while Continuous Deployment automatically deploys changes without human intervention.

**Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background**
> GitHub is a place where developers store and work on their code, allowing teams to collaborate and integrate their work with the CI/CD process.

## Reflection
**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
> My learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README are to gain a better understanding of Node.js, Express, testing practices, and CI/CD workflows.
