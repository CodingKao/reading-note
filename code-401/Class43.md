## Getting started with react native

**Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.**
>
> - `<View>`: It's like a container that can hold other components and provides layout and styling capabilities.
> - `<Text>`: It displays and styles text content, and can also handle touch events.
> - `<Image>`: It displays various types of images in the app.


**What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?**
> React Native solves the problem of developing mobile applications for both Android and iOS platforms using a single codebase. It allows developers to write code in JavaScript and leverage native components and APIs, providing a native-like experience.


**What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?**
> The building blocks of a React Native app are views. Views are basic rectangular elements used to display text, images, or respond to user input. They can be nested inside each other to create complex UI structures. In comparison, a React app also uses components as building blocks, but React Native focuses on mobile-specific components and APIs to build native mobile apps, while React is primarily used for web development.

## Expo

**What solution does expo provide?**
> Expo provides a platform for developers to build native apps for Android, iOS, and the web using JavaScript.


**Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.**
> "easy"


**What is the difference between React Native and Expo?**
> React Native is a framework for building native apps using JavaScript, while Expo is a set of tools and services built on top of React Native to simplify development and provide additional features.


## Expo snack

**Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?**
> snack.expo.dev allows you to write and run React Native code directly in your browser, providing an interactive environment to experiment, prototype, and share React Native projects.


## Ejecting

**What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?**
> "Eject" in the context of Expo means leaving the standard Expo development environment and gaining more control over the native code and build configuration of your app.


**When should you not eject?**
> You should not eject if you prefer the convenience of the standard Expo development environment and don't need extensive customization or direct access to native code.


**Why might you choose to eject?**
> You might choose to eject if you need full control over the native Android and iOS projects, want to include additional native code libraries, or have advanced customization requirements beyond what Expo offers in its standard development environment.

## Reflection

**Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**
> Looking forward to learning more about React Native


**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
> To gain an understanding of React Native development workflow, Expo development environment, and create a functional mobile application utilizing device-specific features.
