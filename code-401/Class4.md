## nosql vs sql

**What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?**
> 
SQL database.

**What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?**
> NoSQL database.

**Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.**
> SQL databases can have trouble handling really large amounts of data, while NoSQL databases are designed to handle massive amounts of data and scale easily.

## sql modeling techniques

**Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?**
> A one-to-many relationship is when an entry in one table can be associated with multiple entries in another table. We relate them using foreign key columns.

**Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.**
> Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to create a diagram of the database tables and their relationships.

**Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.**
> Primary key uniquely identifies rows in a table, while foreign key establishes relationships between tables.

## sql vs nosql

**How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?**
> Keywords in SQL are reserved and have predefined meanings, while parameters are values that can be passed to SQL statements dynamically.

**Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.**
> Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and improve efficiency.

**Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.**
> In one-to-one, one person is associated with another. In one-to-many, one person is associated with multiple others. In many-to-many, multiple people are associated with multiple others.

## Reflection

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
> My learning goals are to utilize SQL and NoSQL is future assignments and projects.
