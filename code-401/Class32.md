## Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

**How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)**

> The useReducer and useContext hooks in React work together to simplify state management in a React application. With useReducer, we can consolidate the state update logic of a component into a reducer function. This helps keep event handlers concise and maintainable. However, as the application grows larger, passing state and functions through props to multiple components can become cumbersome and repetitive.
>
> To address this, we can combine useReducer with useContext. useContext allows us to create contexts in which we can pass information deep down to other components without the need for prop drilling. By creating separate contexts for state and dispatch functions, we can provide the current state and the function to update it to the entire component tree below.
>
> By using these contexts, components no longer need to explicitly pass down state and event handlers as props. Instead, they can directly access the state and dispatch actions from the contexts. This streamlines the code and makes it easier to manage and update state in complex screens. Furthermore, by moving the reducer and context into a single file, we can declutter the components and focus on what they display rather than how they get the data.
>
> In summary, useReducer and useContext work hand in hand to simplify state management by consolidating state update logic and providing a convenient way to pass information between components. They eliminate the need for excessive prop drilling, making it easier to access and update state in larger React applications.
