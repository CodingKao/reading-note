## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice
> Improving your hard technical skills is key to building better software. Deliberate practice, designed to push you outside your comfort zone, repeated often, with feedback on results and challenging goals is necessary to upgrade your skills. As we progress in our careers, opportunities for really pushing ourselves become fewer, and we cannot rely on our day job to continually challenge us. We need to set ourselves small, finishable challenges that teach us something new and push us further outside our comfort zone.
