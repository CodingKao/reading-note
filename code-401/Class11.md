## Event Driven Programming

**What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**
> The native Node.js module that allows us to begin Event Driven Programming is called the "events" module. It provides the necessary functionality for handling and emitting events.

**What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**
> Object Oriented Programming (OOP) enhances Event Driven Programming by offering modularity, code reusability, and improved code maintenance and scalability.

**Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**
> Event Driven Programming in the backend using Node.js is beneficial because it allows for handling multiple requests simultaneously, making web applications more responsive and efficient in processing user actions.

**Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**
> I'm looking forward to learning ore about Event Driven Programming in the backend and Network Events. 


**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
> My learning goals are to learn more about Event Driven Applications and how to implement the Observer pattern and create modular event based systems.
