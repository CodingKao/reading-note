## The Command Line 
> To use the command line in Linux, I need to open a terminal. The terminal is an application that allows me to interact with the shell, typically bash. Once I have access to the shell, I can enter commands using text input, execute them, and see the results in the terminal. I find that using shortcuts such as tab completion or arrow keys can make navigating and using the command line more efficient.


## Basic Navigation
> When using the command line in Linux, I use the command "pwd" to display the current location or directory I'm in. To navigate through the file system, I can use either absolute paths, which start from the root directory, or relative paths, which are relative to the current directory. To move around in the terminal, I can use the "cd" command, followed by a directory name or path.


## More About Files
> When using the command line in Linux, I remember that everything is a file, including directories and devices. Linux is an extensionless system, so file extensions are not necessary, but can be used for convenience. Linux is also case sensitive, so I need to pay attention to capitalization. To deal with spaces in names, I can use quotes or escape characters. Hidden files and directories are preceded by a dot and can be shown with the "-a" option in the "ls" command.


## Manual Pages 
> When using the command line in Linux, I can access manual pages for commands by using the "man" command followed by the name of the command. I can also search for specific options within commands by using the "<term>" option. Additionally, I can use the "n" command to navigate through search results and find the specific information I need. Commands often have short and longhand versions, with short versions using a single dash followed by a letter and long versions using two dashes followed by a word.


## File Manipulation
> When using the command line in Linux, I can create a directory using the "mkdir" command followed by the name of the directory. I can remove a directory using the "rmdir" command or the "rm" command with the "-r" option. I can create a blank file using the "touch" command, and copy, move, or rename files and directories using the "cp", "mv", and "mv" commands, respectively.


## Cheat Sheet
> I find that using the Linux tutorial cheat sheet provided by Ryan's tutorials is helpful when learning and using the command line. It provides a quick reference for common commands and their syntax, making it easy to look up information as needed.
