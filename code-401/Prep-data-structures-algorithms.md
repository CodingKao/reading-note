## Data Structures and Algorithms

**What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**
> When deciding on a data structure, it's important to consider the efficiency of operations required by the problem to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.

**How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**
> To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, we can set a base case or termination condition within the recursive function that will stop the recursion when it is met.
