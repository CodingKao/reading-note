## Functional Programming Concepts

**What is functional programming?**
> A programming paradigm that emphasizes on the use of functions to perform computations and avoids changing state and mutable data.

**What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**
> A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for a given input and does not have any side effects, such as modifying a variable outside its scope.

**What are the benefits of a pure function?**
> Predictability, testability, reusability, and avoiding programming pitfalls such as race conditions and unexpected behavior.

**What is immutability?**
> Immutability is the characteristic of an object or data structure that cannot be modified after creation.

**What is Referential transparency?**
> Referential transparency is the property of a function that always returns the same output for a given input.

**What does componentDidMount do?**
> componentDidMount is a React lifecycle method that is invoked immediately after a component is mounted.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

**What is a module?**
> A module is a self-contained unit of code that can be reused and imported into other code.

**What does the word ‘require’ do?**
> 'require' is a function used in Node.js to load and import external modules.

**How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**
> We use the 'import' keyword followed by the name of the module to bring it into the current file.

**What do we have to do to make a module available?**
> To make a module available, we must export it using the 'export' keyword followed by the module name.
