## SQL vs NoSQL
**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

**SQL**

> SQL databases store data in fixed schemas within tables.

> SQL databases excel at complex queries and transactions, ideal for finance.

> SQL databases ensure data is consistently up-to-date and accurate.

> SQL databases use SQL for querying and manipulating data.

> SQL databases have a long history and established best practices.


**NoSQL**
> NoSQL databases are non-relational databases, meaning that they don't rely on a fixed schema and data can be stored in a variety of formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.

> NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require scalability and performance, such as big data and real-time web applications.

> NoSQL databases prioritize speed over consistency, potentially causing data inconsistencies.

> NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages, depending on the database type, such as MongoDB's query language or Cassandra's CQL (Cassandra Query Language).

> NoSQL databases are a relatively new technology, and while they have gained popularity in recent years, there is still a lack of industry standards and best practices.
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**
> Data that requires complex queries, transactions, and strong consistency, such as financial or accounting data, is a good fit for an SQL database.

**Give a real world example.**
> A bank's customer account information, which requires precise and accurate data management, would be well-suited for an SQL database.


**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**
> Data that requires high scalability, flexibility, and fast performance, such as social media or e-commerce applications, is a good fit for a NoSQL database.

**Give a real world example.**
> An e-commerce website that handles millions of product listings and user data would benefit from a NoSQL database like MongoDB to achieve high scalability and performance.


**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**
> A document-oriented NoSQL database like MongoDB is best for hierarchical data storage where data is organized in a tree-like structure.


**Which type of database is best for scalability??**
> NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra or MongoDB, are best for scalability due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and traffic with high performanc

**What does SQL stand for?**
> Structured Query Language.


**What is a relational database?**
> A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables with defined relationships between them.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**
> A relational database works with a structured data model where data is organized into tables with defined columns and rows.


**What is a ‘schema’?**
> A schema defines the structure and organization of a relational database, including tables, relationships, and data constraints.

**What is a NoSQL database?**
> A NoSQL database is a type of database that does not use a structured table-based schema, and is designed to handle large and diverse data sets with flexible data models.

**How does it work?**
> NoSQL databases use flexible data models and distributed architectures to achieve high scalability and fault tolerance.

**What is inside of a MongoDB database?**
> MongoDB databases contain collections of flexible BSON-format documents.


**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**
> MongoDB is more flexible than SQL due to its dynamic schema, which allows for easier adaptation to changing data structures.

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**
> NoSQL databases may lack data consistency and transactional integrity compared to traditional relational databases in distributed environments with high write volumes.
