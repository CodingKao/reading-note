## How I explained REST to my brother

**Who is Roy Fielding?**
> Roy Fielding is a computer scientist and one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the architectural principles of the World Wide Web.

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
> The techniques taught in a typical computer networking class are suitable for small and predictable networks, but the internet's global scale with millions of unique devices and constantly changing traffic requires different approaches.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
> Fielding and his colleagues created the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.

**What does a GET do?**
> A GET request method is used to retrieve data or a resource from a server. It requests the server to transmit a representation of a resource identified by a URL to the client.

**What does a POST do?**
> A POST request sends data to a server to create or update a resource.

**What does PUT do?**
> PUT is an HTTP method that is used to update or replace a resource on a server.

**What does PATCH do?**
> PATCH is an HTTP method used to partially update an existing resource on the server.
