## My Reading Journal for Code Fellows

Hello! My name is Kao Saelor and I was born in Thailand.  I have served in the United States Marine Corps where I was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, CA.  I am also a recent graduate of the University of Portland's Master of Finance program.  I hope to use what I've learn in this course to create powerful and effective financial applications.

Welcome to my Reading Notes Learning Journal and I'm excited to share my journey of learning and exploring through reading.  With this journal, I'll be logging my reading notes, reflections, and insights as I work my way through learning how to code. I'm looking forward to the journey ahead and I hope you'll join me!
