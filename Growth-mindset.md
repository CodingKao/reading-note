## Growth Mindset

Growth mindset to me means having a positive attitude towards learning and understanding that failure is a part of any learning process. It encourages individuals to focus on improvement and to continue to strive for excellence.


## Mindset Reminder:

  *1. **Embrace challenges:** A growth mindset allows you to take on new challenges with enthusiasm instead of fear.*

  *2. **Learn from feedback:** With a growth mindset, you can use constructive criticism to help you improve.*

  *3. **Believe in yourself:** A growth mindset allows you to believe in your abilities and that you can persevere through difficult times.*
